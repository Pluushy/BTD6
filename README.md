# BTD6 scripts for pixel-perfect placements
AHK scripts for pixel-perfect placements on certain BTD6 maps. For these to work, you NEED to use full screen and 1920x1080. I also suggest you to run the script as an admin.

Nothing is worse than losing purely because you can't get those pixel-perfect placements every retry.

I use numpad numbers as hotkeys in my scripts. If you don't have a numpad or don't wish to use those hotkeys, change them (look it up).

Look through the scripts, as I will note what hotkey is what monkey/hero.
